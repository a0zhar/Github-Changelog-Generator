# Introduction
I looked everywhere for an easy-to-use tool to create changelogs from GitHub commits, but couldn't find a simple website solution. So, I built one myself! With this tool, there's no need to install software or sign up for anything—**no hassle at all**. I hope you find it useful!

## How to Use It
Just enter the **GitHub Account Username** and the **GitHub Repository Name**.  
Then, click the button, and voilà—your changelog is ready to copy and paste!

## Output (Example)
```md
### Patches made on <YYYY-MM-DD>
- <Commit Title>
  - <Additional Data>
  - <Additional Data>
  - <Additional Data>
  - <Additional Data>
- <Commit Title>
- <Commit Title>
- <Commit Title>
```
